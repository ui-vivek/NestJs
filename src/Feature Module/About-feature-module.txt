Feature modules in NestJS are a way to organize and structure your application's code. They are a way to group related code together, making it easier to understand and maintain.

In NestJS, a feature module is typically defined in a separate file, and it contains the components, providers, and other dependencies that are specific to a particular feature or area of the application. This can include controllers, services, models, and other classes that are used by that feature.

Feature modules can be nested, allowing you to organize your code even further. This can be useful when you have a large application with many features, or when you want to break down a large feature into smaller, more manageable pieces.

Feature modules have several benefits, including:

Modularity: Feature modules allow you to break down your application into smaller, more manageable units, making it easier to understand and maintain.
Testability: Since feature modules are typically defined in separate files, they can be tested independently, which can improve the quality of your tests.
Scalability: Feature modules can be easily reused and combined, making it easier to scale your application as your needs change.


Overall, feature modules are a powerful tool that can help you organize and structure your NestJS application, making it easier to understand, maintain, and scale.

NOTE : A feature module simply organizes code relevant for a specific feature, keeping code organized and establishing clear boundaries.
